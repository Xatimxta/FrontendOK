                    standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
                    when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has
                    survived not only five centuries,
                    but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised
                    in
                    the 1960s with the release of Letraset
                    sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
                    Aldus
                    PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
